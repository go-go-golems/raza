# raza : keep history forever

raza is a tool (client, server) meant to keep your shell history forever,
across devices. Every command you enter is stored in a database, and available
for query. It automatically synchronizes across devices, and works even if you are offline.

See [hacking notes](hacking-notes.md) for a free-flowing brainstorm of what this app should be.
